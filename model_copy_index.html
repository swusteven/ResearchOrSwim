      away.</p><br>
    <p>ReserchOrSwim is a stock investing analytics dashboard based on <span>price momemtum</span>, <span>earning
        fundamentals</span> and <span>Wallstreet sentiments</span>. The dashboard
      provides a single-page view to users that includes the following:
    <ul>
      <li>1-yr Historical price chart with a 30-days moving average for momentum investing.</li>
      <li>Yearly earnings for fundamentals investing.</li>
      <li>Wallstreet sentiment based on analysts recommendations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="modal-h2">Instructions:</h2>
    <p>Enter the stock symbol in the upper left search field. ResearchOrSwim will do all the works for you</p>
    <p>Analytics result will display in the upper right section: Recommended or Not Recommended</p>
    <p>Search again if you want to check out another company</p><br>
    <h2 class="modal-h2">Analytics and Rules:</h2>

    <p>In addition, ResearchOrSwim performs analysis based on below investment principles/rules and then
      recommend a 'buy' only if it passed all test levels.


    <h2>Buy recommendation logic:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Price Momentum: passed only if price moving average from last 30 days is increasing.</li>
      <li>Company Earnings: passed only if earning is positive and YoY growth in the last two years was 10% or more.
      </li>
      <li>Analyst Recommendation: passed only if 50% of the analysts recommended Strong Buy or Buy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This provides great benefits to investors who implement investment strategies strictly based on the defined
      rules,rather than sentiments.</p><br>
